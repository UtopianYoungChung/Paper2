abstract: "This paper explores several potential explanatory factors for the steep decline in birth rates in the United States between 2007 and 2020. The decline in U.S. birthrates offers some significant insights into U.S. society. Changes in birth patterns among recent young adult women moving through the childbearing age group can be directly related to the decline in birth rate from a purely statistical standpoint. We provide evidence that the steep drop in birth rates could be attributed to recent young adults' shifting interests. These shifting priorities represent changes in young adults' preferences regarding having children and aspirations for life. Resonating with the original paper, we conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of the declining birth rate in the United States and its impact on society as an entirety."

# Introduction

To measure birth rates, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) aggregates data on birth rates for women by age, race, education level, and other factors; the aggregated data for a particular year is the total number of births per 1000 women. Each year NCHS measures birth rates nationwide and analyzes the data to make insights into societal phenomena. For instance, in 1997, NCHS published a paper on how a mother's education level influences the birth rate. In the paper, NCHS asserted that there is a negative correlation between a mother's education level and birth rate. Their study found a direct relationship between years of education and birth rates, with the highest birth rates among women with the lowest educational attainment @citeNCHS.

In this paper, we gathered data from the American Economic Association, National Center for Health Statistics, and the U.S. population data. With gathered data, we generated graphs and tables to observe the trend in birth rates of different demographics, using R [@citeR]. We also uploaded and cleaned data using R [@citeR], tidyr [@citetidyr], dplyr [@citedplyr], tidyverse [@citetidyverse], and haven [@citehaven] packages. Figures and tables were created with knitr [@citeknit], ggplot2 [@citeggplot], kableExtra [@citekable], and dplyr [@citedplyr].  

@fig-1 depicts U.S. birth rate trends over the last 40 years. In Figure 1, we can see that the trend is fluctuating relatively stable. However, during the post-2007 recession, it takes a steep decline with no sign of turning back.

In @sec-first-point, we discuss how decomposing the decline in the birth rate between demographic groups helps us to have a clearer picture of the topic. As can be seen in @fig-2 and @fig-3

@sec-second-point, briefly discusses the empirical relationship between birth rates and economics and policy factors. We then argue that other economic, policy or social factors that have changed since 2007 do not contribute much to the decline.

@sec-third-point, presents a potential attributing factor for the declining U.S. birth rate after the 2007 recession. We show strong evidence that suggests the most recent group of young adults is a significant driver of the post-2007 decline in the birth rate. This significance suggests that the societal shifts among young women moving through childbearing age are an ongoing trend.

We conclude the paper by raising a concern that this societal phenomenon imposes some severe societal consequences and, therefore, should be considered at a high level. Most importantly, we need to consider what it means for the nation's well-being when there are no signs of returning from the negative trend in birth rates.
